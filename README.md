# Wayfarer

## Mission
Design a travel website, for the shadowy organization Wayfarer*.
- Tackle 4 Sprints
- Present an MVP to investors in four days time.
- Overwhelm them with our wit and coding prowess.
- Get the job!!! $$$

*-This project is not associated with any actual company named Wayfarer. ðŸ˜‰ 
## Design Decisions
- "The Clients" requested that we create the website using Angular framework.
- We decided to incorporate Bootstrap for our CSS in order to enhance our  familiarity with the technology.
- We chose to deploy on Heroku because we wanted the opportunity to learn how to do that. [Wayfarer](https://wayfarer-sethrichard.herokuapp.com/)

### Sprint 4: It's Raining...(Day 4 and beyond)

2. On a city's page:
  * See post content truncated to 1000 characters max, with a link to view more.

  * Title must be between 1 and 200 characters.
  * Content must not be empty.
4. View only the 10 most recent posts on a city page (pagination), with
  * A link/button to the "Next" 10.
  * A link/button to the "Previous" 10.
5. View all vagabond cities as markers/pins on a map on the site's homepage.
6. Click on a pin on the homepage map and be redirected to the corresponding city page.
